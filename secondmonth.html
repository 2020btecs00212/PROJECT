	<h2>Second Month</h2></center>
		<h3>•	Flowering:</h3>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">In the second month there are comes a small bud. There are two types of bud first are male and second are 
		female .a female bud grows then will a fruit. Male bud not grows into fruit. Flower are grows into small small fruit. Regular irrigation is most 
		important.Every month give the slury for the tree in seven days later.</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">While pomegranate trees are drought tolerant, they do need good, deep irrigation periodically – similar 
		to the requirements for citrus trees. Not only is the plant grown for its delicious fruit (actually a berry), but it is cultivated for the stunning 
		bright red flowers on pomegranate trees. Pomegranates can be a bit pricey, so if you live in a climate that will support growing your own, you have a 
		win/win savvy garden specimen. </p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the tree is fairly resilient, it’s susceptible to several issues and one of them is pomegranate 
		flower drop. If you are lucky enough to own a pomegranate tree, you may be wondering why pomegranate blooms fall and how to prevent bud drop on 
		pomegranate.</p>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Pollination:</b>To answer the question of why pomegranate flowers 
		fall off, we need to know a little about the plants’ reproduction. Pomegranate trees are self-fruitful, which means the flowers on 
		the pomegranate are both male and female. Pollinating insects and hummingbirds assist in spreading the pollen from flower to flower. 
		You can even help too, by using a small brush and lightly brushing from bloom to bloom. Male pomegranate flowers fall off naturally as do 
		un-fertilized female blooms, while fertilized female flowers remain to become fruit.</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Pests:</b>Pomegranate trees begin to flower in May and continue 
		through early autumn. If your pomegranate flowers fall off in early spring, the culprit may be insect infestation such as whitefly, 
		scale or mealybugs. Inspect the tree for damage and consult your local nursery or a Recommendation regarding the use of insecticide.</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Disease:</b>Another possible reason for pomegranate flower drop may be due to a 
		fungal disease or root rot. An anti-fungal spray should be applied and again, the local nursery can help with this.</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Environmental:</b>The tree may drop flowers due to cold temperatures as well,
		so it is a good idea to protect or move the tree if a chill is in the forecast. Finally, although the tree is drought resistant, 
		it still needs a good deep watering if you want it to produce fruit. Too little water will cause the blossoms to drop from the tree. 
		Pomegranate trees need to be mature to produce fruit, three to five years or so. Prior to this, as long as the tree is watered, fertilized, 
		pollinated properly, and free of pests and disease, a little pomegranate flower drop is perfectly natural and no cause for alarm. Just be 
		patient and eventually you, too, can be enjoying the delicious ruby Red fruit of your very own exotic pomegranate.</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Apiculture on pomegranate:</b>Last spring you may have seen honey bees 
		pollinating the showy pomegranate blossoms.The ancient fruit, first cultivated around 4000 B.C. in Persia and known as "the fruit of kings," 
		bursts with flavor, antioxidants and medicinal qualities. Honeybee is used for growth of flower to fruit.</p>
