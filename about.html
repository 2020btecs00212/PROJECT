	(Punica granatum) is one of the important commercial fruit. It is assumed that it is native fruit of the Persia; Nowadays known as IRAN. 
	It is more beneficial economically as you have once started its farming, than they give yield more than 150 years.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Pomegranate fruit has lots of its medical benefits along with its greater demand in market. 
	This fruit can be utilized in fresh form or in the form of its products like Juice, Jam, Squash, Syrup, Canned slice etc. 
	In india, about more than 70% of is products are canned slice and juice, the most demanding product of the Pomegranate fruit in local market.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">In the World, Pomegranate is commonly cultivated in the Caucasus region, Africa, Central Asia along with the 
	Indian subcontinent. In India, It is commonly cultivated in the Maharashtra along with the small region of the nearby state; Gujarat, Telangana, 
	Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Utter Pradesh and Haryana.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">India is the largest producer of this fruits, mainly export abroad in Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, 
	U.A.E., etc. There is great demands of “Ganesh and Aarakta” Pomegranate fruit in the international markets. Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) 
	is an important fruit crop grown in India.it is originated in Iran and extensively Pomegranate farming in done in the Mediterranean countries like Spain, 
	Morocco, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan. It is cultivated to some extort in Myanmar, China, USA, and India. India ranks first in pomegranate 
	cultivation in the world. In India major pomegranate producing states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and 
	Rajasthan.</p
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Maharashtra is leading with 90 thousand ha area with annual production of 9.45 lakh Mt tones and 
	productivity of 10.5 Mt/ha.Maharashtra state accounts for 78 percent of the total area in India and 84 percent of the total production in the country.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Pomegranate is one of the most favorite table fruits. The fresh fruits are used for table purpose and also can be 
	used for the preparation of processed products like juice, syrup, squash, jelly, anar rub, juice concentrates, carbonated cold-drinks, anar dana tablets, 
	acids, etc. Pomegranate fruit is nutritious, rich in minerals, vitamins, and proteins. The juice is useful for leprosy suffering patients. Pomegranate is a 
	table fruit that is grown in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the globe. Pomegranate fruit is one of the most popular, nutritionally rich fruit with 
	unique flavour, taste and medicinal properties. </p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">The pomegranate tree is also grown as an ornamental plant which produces very attractive red flowers. 
	Commercial cultivation of Pomegranate is very much successful in most of the Asian countries. This plant is hardy in nature and has very low maintenance 
	cost with high yielding potential and has versatile adaptability. Pomegranate belongs to the family of “Lythraceae” and genus of “Punica”. Pomegranate is 
	originated from Iran and spread across the world. Currently pomegranate is widely cultivated throughout the Middle East and Caucasus region, North Africa and 
	tropical Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia. Pomegranate can be easily grown in pots, containers and back yards. Pomegranate is one of the 
	commercial fruit crops of India. It is native to Iran (Persia). Pomegranate is known as a drought-tolerant crop, yet regular irrigation is mandatory to 
	commercial yield production. </p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Water levels and optimal irrigation regime depend on a plurality of factors as soil type, tree size, physiological phase, 
	and potential evaporation. As a rule, the tree needs little supplemental irrigation. The commonly used irrigation regime in pomegranate orchards relies 
	mainly on the experience gained by growers and less on formal experiments</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Climate Requirements for Pomegranate Cultivation:– </b>Pomegranate crop prefers dry climate 
	grows up to an elevation of 1800 meter and especially during fruit development stage, prolonged hot and dry climate is mandatory for better growth and yield. 
	The Optimum temperature for fruit development is 36°C to 38°C.Pomegranate fruits are easily damaged in humid climatic conditions by pomegranate butterfly and 
	will not develop sweetness in the fruit.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Pomegranate prefers a dry climate. During fruit development, prolonged hot and dry climate is required. Optimum 
	temperature congenial for fruit development is 38°C. In a humid climate, the fruits are severely damaged by pomegranate butterfly and do not develop 
	sweetness. It is winter hardy and very drought tolerant. It can grow up to an elevation of 1850 meters.</p>

	</br><br/>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman">Pomegranate grows well under semi-arid conditions and can be grown up to an altitude of 500 m. above m.s.l. 
	It thrives well under hot, dry summer and cold winter provided irrigation facilities are available. The tree requires hot and dry climate especially 
	during the fruit development and ripening. The Pomegranate tree is deciduous in areas of low winter temperature and evergreen or partially deciduous in 
	tropical and sub-tropical conditions. It can tolerate frost to a considerable extent in the dormant stage but is injured at a temperature below -11°C.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Soil Requirements for Pomegranate Cultivation:-</b>Pomegranate can be cultivated 
	in wide range of soils. However, well-drained, deep loamy soils rich in organic matter are best for its cultivation. This crop can tolerate even alkalinity 
	and salinity to certain extent but a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0 is best. The only soil that will not support pomegranates is heavy clay, because soils with 
	excessive clay tend to present drainage problems. The main problem of this crop is it is very sensitive to soil moisture fluctuations causing fruit 
	cracking.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Land Preparation, Planting in Pomegranate Cultivation:- </b>Land should be prepared by 
	giving 2 or 3 ploughings and providing proper channels. Remove any weeds from previous crops. Generally, planting distance depends on soil type and 
	climatic conditions.  Old orchards were planted at 3 meter to 6 meter space where as new dwarf varieties are recommended to plat at a spacing of 
	4 meter x 4 meter which accommodates about 625 plants per 1 hectare land. Rooted cuttings or layers of 12 to 18 months old can be planted during June 
	to December in pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm.</p>

	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"></p>
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Irrigation in Pomegranate Cultivation:- </b>Drainage is one of the most important 
	factors to consider in growing pomegranate crop as these plants are very sensitive to water logged conditions. Irrigation should be given depending on 
	soil, climate and availability of water. Drip irrigation can be adopted for better utilization of water. Pomegranate crop does not require any irrigation 
	in rainy season. However, in very dry and hot weather conditions, irrigation should be given once in 4 days.</p>
	
	<p style="font-family: Times New Roman"><b style="font-size:20px">•	Pomegranate Planting System	</b>In the rainy season, air leveling take place and 
	is also done in November-December. After air leveling, planting is done in the spring and later on in some tropical region. Usually, planting with high 
	density, yields 2-2.5 more than the common density planting. The normal spacing for planting is square of 5*5 meters; commonly used in the north India 
	along with the Deccan Plateau. In present, new grower used 2.5*4.5 spacing planting to get greater amount of yield. More closer spacing will increase the 
	chance of pest incidence. Ninety-day old Pomegranate plants ready for transplanting into the main field in pits. Prepare a suitable size of the pit is 
	60 cm x 6o cm x 60. Most ideal planting distance followed by farmers is 10 to 12 ft (3 to 3.6 m) between plants and 13-15 ft (3.9 to 4.5 m) between rows. 
	During monsoon, pits are filled with farmyard manure (10 kg), single superphosphate (500 gm), neem-cake (1 kg). The optimum time for pomegranate planting 
	is in the rainy season (July-August) when sufficient soil moisture is available for optimum growth of plants.</p>
